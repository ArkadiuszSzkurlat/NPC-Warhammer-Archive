## General Information
An application created in the React that allows you to save the NPC Heroes of the Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay game. Personally, I needed a place to store the NPCs created for the campaign somewhere. I didn't see such application anywhere so I decided to create it myself.

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Firebase


## Features
- Register, Login, Forgot password and Delete account funcionality
- Create an editable Warhammer NPC

## Setup and Usage
All depedencies are in package.json, but to run app you need a firebase.
To start using at localhost:
